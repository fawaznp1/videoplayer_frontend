React - Front end Technology
-------------------------------
-to create UI(User Interface)

UI :
----------
The point where the user -computer (SW) interaction/communication takeplace

- React make use of JS libraries to create UI/Front end
-libraries : predefined codes- to do particular task
-Framework : predefined codes - highly restricted
[refer libraries vs Framework]

Features of React -
------------
1.To create UI
2.Single page application : 
    -Web application or website that interact with dynamically rewriting the current webpage with new datas from the webserver instead of the default method of loading all webpage separately.
3.Declarative : 
    -Does not access directly DOM(Document Object Model)
    -Instead, it creates and manages Virtual DOM tree that is later updated in real DOM
4.Virtual DOM : 
    -An exact copy of DOM ,React can update only what has changed in VDOM and then render on screen.This way browser have less process.VDOM is created by React.
    -Diffin : process of comparing VDOM with real DOM
    -Reconcilation ; process of updatintg real DOM.
5.Immutable variable : 
    -Cannot change the value of an Object.
6.Pure Function : 
    -Functions that accept Immutable variable and return an Object. - result only depend on variable.
    -eg : React Components
7.Data Sharing : Unidirection -parent -child
8.Language : JSX - JS XML (combination of js ,html,css)
9.Transpiling : Process of converting JSX into html,css,js
    -BABEL : convert

How to create a project in React
-----------------------------------

 
npx create-react-app projectname
 (npx - node package execute - help to execute
 npm - node package manager - help to install)


npm i -g npm   - Globalization
1.npx create-react-app projectname  - (Happy hacking!)
2.cd projectname
3.npm start

---------------------------------

Files : 
1.readme.md : hold description of the application
2.package.json - holds npm configuration - dependencies.
3.package-lock.json : it holds versions of installed libraries.
4. .gitigonre - hlod Files that need not tobe pushed into git 
5.node_modules - its a copy of installed libraries.
6.public - holds those Files 
7.
8.reportWebVitals : used to measure performance


Component : basic unit of react application
React Component is a function which returns HTML elements.-
    -should start with capital letter
    -
    1.export

React event handling:
There are three ways to handle events in React applications:
html onclick ="function()"
jsx onclick={}
function without arguement
    onclick = {function name}
    function with arguments
    onClick={()=>function name(arg)}


How to get value from input box:
----
html=input.value

onChange(callback)-call 


conditional rendering:
---------------------------------
Render : loading to browser

1.if - truthy -&&
2.if else - ternary- ?:


react state :
-----------------
    -State is an object which stores properties of a react class Component
    -When the state changes the entire component re-render.




Life cycle of a react class component:
------------------------------------
1.mounting phase : component added to DOM
-constructor()-
-getDerivedStateFromProps()-
-render()
-componentDidMount
2.updating phase : editing of component
-getDerivedStateFromProps()-
-shouldComponentUpdate -true or false
-render()
-getSnapShotBeForUpdate()
-componentDidUpdate()
3.Unmounting phase : removal of component from DOM
-componentWillUnmount()  :
    invoked just before the unmount to cancel if there any network is done etc...
    inshot it cleanup

Functional component are also called stateless component
Class component are also called stateful component

Hooks:
------
-To provide state and lifecycle to Functional components.
-A hook is a function that lets you "hook into" React features. For example, useState is a hook that enables your components to have local state.

Rules:
--------
1.import hooks from react library to react Functional component
2.can call hook only at the top section of then functional component
3.Cannot use hooks on conditional bases.


There are different types of hooks:
--------------------------------
1.predefined hooks                      2.custom hooks
eg:
-useState()  :                           
    -to create state in functional component
    -returns - state and function which can change the state.
    -can store - string ,number, object ,array

Drag and drop mechanism:
    It can be achieved using 5 properties 
    1.Dragable
    2.ondragstart
    3.dropable
    4.ondragover
    5.ondrop

    1.Dragable:
        When added as an attribute to an element ,makes the target element to become dragable.
    2.ondragstart:
        is called immeediately the element drag.usually the content to be dragged above the set at the point.
    3.dropable:
        when added has an attribute to an element ,makes the target become dropable.
    4.ondragover:
        when added has eventListener where the dragged content will be dropped.In another words it is used to specify where the content to be dropped. 
    5.ondrop:
        is called immeediately the dragged content is released on the element that contains ondrag eventListener.
